The Python code is using the sklearn library to create and evaluate a classification model using the Random Forest algorithm. Here are the key points:

Data Preparation: Importing the ‘Credit.csv’ dataset, transforming categorical variables with LabelEncoder, and splitting into training and test sets.
Random Forest Modeling: Creating a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees, training with the training data, and making predictions on the test set.
Model Evaluation: Using a confusion matrix and accuracy rate to evaluate predictions, as well as the ROC curve to analyze the model’s performance.
Visualization: Generating graphs for the confusion matrix, feature importance, and learning curves, making it easier to interpret the model’s results. Please write in English.
